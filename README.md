## CI/CD Pipeline for a UI5 Application in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Environment

This repository demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline for a UI5 app that is deployed in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Environment. The repo hopes to give a rough idea how such a pipeline would work and can be considered a good starting point for CI/CD designs.

## Implementation notes

- Azure DevOps was the CI/CD platform of choice.

- New builds and deployments will be triggered when new code is pushed to the master branch.

- An AzureDevOps YAML pipeline was used

### Build and Deploy Process

The `azure-pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml` outlines the steps of the build and deploy process.

There are three stages currently in this pipeline;

1.  Build
2.  Test (Mock tests used)
3.  Deploy
